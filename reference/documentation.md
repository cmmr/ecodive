## Arguments

- alpha:

  How much weight to give to relative abundances; a value between 0 and
  1, inclusive. Setting `alpha=1` is equivalent to
  [`normalized_unifrac()`](https://cmmr.github.io/ecodive/reference/normalized_unifrac.md).

- counts:

  A numeric matrix of count data (samples \\\times\\ features).
  Typically contains absolute abundances (integer counts), though
  proportions are also accepted.

- cpus:

  How many parallel processing threads should be used. The default,
  [`n_cpus()`](https://cmmr.github.io/ecodive/reference/n_cpus.md), will
  use all logical CPU cores.

- cutoff:

  The maximum number of observations to consider "rare". Default: `10`.

- digits:

  Precision of the returned values, in number of decimal places. E.g.
  the default `digits=3` could return `6.392`.

- norm:

  Normalize the incoming counts. Options are:

  - `'none'`: No transformation.

  - `'percent'`: Relative abundance (sample abundances sum to 1).

  - `'binary'`: Unweighted presence/absence (each count is either 0 or
    1).

  - `'clr'`: Centered log ratio.

  Default: `'none'`.

- pairs:

  Which combinations of samples should distances be calculated for? The
  default value (`NULL`) calculates all-vs-all. Provide a numeric or
  logical vector specifying positions in the distance matrix to
  calculate. See examples.

- power:

  Scaling factor for the magnitude of differences between communities
  (\\p\\). Default: `1.5`

- pseudocount:

  The value to add to all counts in `counts` to prevent taking `log(0)`
  for unobserved features. The default, `NULL`, selects the smallest
  non-zero value in `counts`.

- margin:

  The margin containing samples. `1` if samples are rows, `2` if samples
  are columns. Ignored when `counts` is a special object class (e.g.
  `phyloseq`). Default: `1`

- tree:

  A `phylo`-class object representing the phylogenetic tree for the OTUs
  in `counts`. The OTU identifiers given by `colnames(counts)` must be
  present in `tree`. Can be omitted if a tree is embedded with the
  `counts` object or as `attr(counts, 'tree')`.

## Input Types

The `counts` parameter is designed to accept a simple numeric matrix,
but seamlessly supports objects from the following biological data
packages:

- `phyloseq`

- `rbiom`

- `SummarizedExperiment`

- `TreeSummarizedExperiment`

For large datasets, standard matrix operations may be slow. See
[`vignette('performance')`](https://cmmr.github.io/ecodive/articles/performance.md)
for details on using optimized formats (e.g. sparse matrices) and
parallel processing.
