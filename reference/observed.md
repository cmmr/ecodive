# Observed Features

The count of unique features (richness) in a sample.

## Usage

``` r
observed(counts, margin = 1L, cpus = n_cpus())
```

## Arguments

- counts:

  A numeric matrix of count data where each column is a feature, and
  each row is a sample. Any object coercible with
  [`as.matrix()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/matrix.html) can be given here,
  as well as `phyloseq`, `rbiom`, `SummarizedExperiment`, and
  `TreeSummarizedExperiment` objects. For optimal performance with very
  large datasets, see the guide in
  [`vignette('performance')`](https://cmmr.github.io/ecodive/articles/performance.md).

- margin:

  If your samples are in the matrix's rows, set to `1L`. If your samples
  are in columns, set to `2L`. Ignored when `counts` is a `phyloseq`,
  `rbiom`, `SummarizedExperiment`, or `TreeSummarizedExperiment` object.
  Default: `1L`

- cpus:

  How many parallel processing threads should be used. The default,
  [`n_cpus()`](https://cmmr.github.io/ecodive/reference/n_cpus.md), will
  use all logical CPU cores.

## Details

Observed features is defined simply as the number of features with
non-zero abundance: \$\$n\$\$

**Base R Equivalent:**

    sum(x > 0)
