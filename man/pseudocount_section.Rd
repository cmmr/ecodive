\section{Pseudocount}{

The \code{pseudocount} parameter is only relevant when \code{norm = 'clr'}.

Zeros are undefined in the centered log-ratio (CLR) transformation. If
\code{norm = 'clr'}, \code{pseudocount} is \code{NULL} (the default), and
zeros are detected, the function uses half the minimum non-zero value
(\code{min(x[x>0]) / 2}) and issues a warning.

To suppress the warning, provide an explicit value (e.g., \code{1}).

\strong{Why this matters:} The choice of pseudocount is not neutral; it acts as
a weighting factor that can significantly distort downstream results,
especially for sparse datasets. See Gloor et al. (2017) and Kaul et al.
(2017) for open-access discussions on the mathematical implications, or
Costea et al. (2014) for the impact on community clustering.
