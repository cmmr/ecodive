\title{Rarefy Observation Counts}
\usage{
rarefy(
  counts,
  depth = NULL,
  seed = 0,
  times = NULL,
  drop = TRUE,
  margin = 1L,
  cpus = n_cpus(),
  warn = interactive()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{A numeric matrix or sparse matrix object (e.g., \code{dgCMatrix}).
Counts must be integers.}

\item{depth}{The number of observations to keep per sample. If \code{NULL}
(the default), a depth is auto-selected to maximize data retention.}

\item{seed}{An integer seed for the random number generator. Providing
the same seed guarantees reproducible results. Default: \code{0}}

\item{times}{The number of independent rarefactions to perform. If set,
returns a list of matrices. Seeds for subsequent iterations are
sequential (\code{seed}, \code{seed + 1}, ...). Default: \code{NULL}}

\item{drop}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, samples with fewer than \code{depth}
observations are discarded. If \code{FALSE}, they are kept with their
original counts. Default: \code{TRUE}}

\item{margin}{The margin containing samples. \code{1} if samples are rows,
\code{2} if samples are columns. Ignored when \code{counts} is a special object
class (e.g. \code{phyloseq}). Default: \code{1}}

\item{cpus}{How many parallel processing threads should be used. The
default, \code{n_cpus()}, will use all logical CPU cores.}

\item{warn}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, emits a warning when samples are dropped
or returned unrarefied due to insufficient depth.
Default: \code{interactive()}}
}
\value{
A rarefied matrix. The output class (\code{matrix}, \code{dgCMatrix}, etc.)
matches the input class.
}
\description{
Sub-sample observations from a feature table such that all samples have the
same library size (depth). This is performed via random sampling without
replacement.
}
\section{Auto-Depth Selection}{

If \code{depth} is \code{NULL}, the function defaults to the highest depth that retains
at least 10\% of the total observations in the dataset.
}

\section{Dropping vs. Retaining Samples}{

If a sample has fewer observations than the specified \code{depth}:
\itemize{
\item \code{drop = TRUE} (Default): The sample is removed from the output matrix.
\item \code{drop = FALSE}: The sample is returned \strong{unmodified} (with its original
counts). It is \emph{not} rarefied or zeroed out.
}
}

\section{Zero-Sum Features}{

Features (OTUs, ASVs, Genes) that lose all observations during rarefaction
are \strong{always retained} as columns/rows of zeros. This ensures the output
matrix dimensions remain consistent with the input (barring dropped samples).
}

\section{Input Types}{


The \code{counts} parameter is designed to accept a simple numeric matrix, but
seamlessly supports objects from the following biological data packages:
\itemize{
\item \code{phyloseq}
\item \code{rbiom}
\item \code{SummarizedExperiment}
\item \code{TreeSummarizedExperiment}
}

For large datasets, standard matrix operations may be slow. See
\code{vignette('performance')} for details on using optimized formats
(e.g. sparse matrices) and parallel processing.

    # A 4-sample x 5-OTU matrix with samples in rows.
    counts <- matrix(c(0,0,0,0,0,8,9,10,5,5,5,5,2,0,0,0,6,5,7,0), 4, 5,
      dimnames = list(LETTERS[1:4], paste0('OTU', 1:5)))
    counts
    rowSums(counts)
    
    # Rarefy all samples to a depth of 18.
    # Sample 'A' (13 counts) and 'D' (15 counts) will be dropped.
    r_mtx <- rarefy(counts, depth = 18)
    r_mtx
    rowSums(r_mtx)
    
    # Keep under-sampled samples by setting `drop = FALSE`.
    # Samples 'A' and 'D' are returned with their original counts.
    r_mtx <- rarefy(counts, depth = 18, drop = FALSE)
    r_mtx
    rowSums(r_mtx)
    
    # Perform 3 independent rarefactions.
    r_list <- rarefy(counts, times = 3)
    length(r_list)
    
    # Sparse matrices are supported and their class is preserved.
    if (requireNamespace('Matrix', quietly = TRUE)) {
      counts_dgC <- Matrix::Matrix(counts, sparse = TRUE)
